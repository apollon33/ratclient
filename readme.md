Here's my super easy RAT source / base. It allows easy text communication between clients and server using sockets. I threw it together fairly quickly and I'm posting it here to get you started on your own development. Consider it a kick in the right direction. It's not using any fancy coding standards or anything like that. So don't expect quality work. 

It does not at it's current stage have any malicious features, and it's not intended for "hacking" peoples computers. It's just a barebones Remote Administration Tool source code.
